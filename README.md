About This App
        Akkies Weathie is a simple and easy-to-use web application that allows
        users to get real-time weather information for any location around the
        world. The application provides detailed information about temperature,
        humidity, wind speed, and more.

How I Built This App
        My name is Akashdip Saha, and I am a College undergrad student from Kalinga 
        Institute of Industrial Technology [2nd year BTECH(CSE)], web developer who built this
        application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the RapidAPI (Weather by API-Ninjas). 
        I used Bootstrap to create the layout and design of the application, and
        jQuery to make API requests and manipulate the DOM.
